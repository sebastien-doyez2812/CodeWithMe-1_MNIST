# CNN Handwritten Digit Recognition Tutorial

## Description
This repository contains the code for a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed to recognize handwritten digits. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** and is capable of accurately predicting the digit from an input image.

This tutorial walks through the process of building, training, and testing the CNN model for digit classification.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Training Script
To train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Testing the Model
Once trained, you can test the model using:
```bash
python test.py
```
